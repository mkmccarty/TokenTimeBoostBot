# TokenTimeBoostBot

Boost Order Management Discord Bot

Allow for easy mobile creation and execution of a sign-up list and boost list for the game Egg Inc.
* There is a limitation of one contract per channel or thread.
* This can be used to run a contract across multiple servers.



The bot does not query information from the Egg Inc servers.

## Basic Setup

Create a discord application here: <https://discord.com/developers/applications>

Take the Application ID and Secret and save those to configure the bot in .config.json.
If you wish to restrict the bot to a specific server then add your Guild ID to **DiscordGuildID**

```
.config.json:
{
 "DiscordToken": "APP_SECRET"
 "DiscordAppID": "APP_ID"
 "DiscordGuildID": "DISCORD_GUILD_ID"
}
```
Install your bot into your discord server with this URL:
<https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=$(BOT_APP_ID)&permissions=466004470848&scope=bot%20applications.commands>

### Create Contract Coop

/contract contract-id coop-id coop-size ping-role

This will display a Sign-up List and a message with reactions for
players to sign up.
When the Sign-up List reaches the coop-size it will automatically
start the contract
The reactions are farmer, bell and dice.
Select farmer and/or bell to sign up on the list
Select the dice as a vote to randomize the Boost List.  
Normally the Boost List will will run in Sign-up Order.  
The vote needs a 2/3 super-majority before electing the random order.

ping-role: The default for this is @here.

## ping-role

Use this to update the ping role for the contract. Select a Role on your server. It's not possible
to select "@here" for the role.

### Start Contract

/start

This will change the Sign-up List to the Boost List. If there is a
order preference it will apply before the Boost List is displayed.
The first farmer on the list is presented with a boost token indicating
that they are the current booster.
The channel receives a message mentioning who's turn it is.
Farmers that reacted with a ðŸ”” will receive a DM about this.

### Boost

The Farmer who's turn it is to receive tokens uses this to indicate that they
are boosting.

selecting the ðŸš€ icon.  Two votes will elect a successful boost.

### Skip Current Booster

/skip

Move current booster to last in the Boost List

### Mark Farmer as Unboosted

/unboost [farmer]

Sometimes mistakes happen and someone is marked as boosting too early. 
Mark someone as unboosted to take care of it. Their position in the boost order stays the same and would boost next if they were earlier in the list than the current booster.

### Prune Farmer

/prune

Remove a Farmer from the Sign-up or Boost List.
This is useful if a Farmer reacted to the Sign-up message and didn't join
the contract within the game.

as Farmers without ðŸ”” DM notifications.
